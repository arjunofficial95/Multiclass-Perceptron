1. Load Task1D_train.csv and Task1D_test.csv sets.

2. Train two multiclass perceptron models on the provided training data by setting the learning rates Î· to .09 and .01 respectively. Note that all parameter settings stay the same, except the learning rate, when building each model.
For each model, evaluate the error of the model on the test data, after processing every 5 training data points (also known as a mini-batch). Then, plot the testing errors of two models built based on the learning rates .09 and .01(with different colors) versus the number of mini-batches.
